# 2.5D Game

### Background:

The goal of this project was creating a game using a given framework and the box2D physics library in C++. The game could have been a recreation of an old classic or a completely new idea. Therefore, "Bubble Bobble" was chosen to be recreated because of its unique game mechanics and addictive nature.

### The Game:

The game simulates an endless version of the original game where the player tries to achieve high scores. The graphics consist of 3D replicas of the original character and monsters made using Magicavoxel. The player can increase their score by collecting cherries while killing monsters trapped in bubbles.
